### **Diary Writing Chat**
Our service provides a feature that allows users to reflect on their day and write a diary through conversations with an AI friend. The chatbot friend asks random questions about the user's daily activities, and by responding, users can look back on their day. Then, based on the user's responses, the AI writes the diary for them.

### **Emotion Extraction and Labeling**
Our service assists users in exploring and understanding their emotions. The chatbot extracts key emotional keywords based on users' diaries, allowing users to select the emotions they felt most closely aligned with, thus gaining a deeper understanding of their emotions. Especially, when unfamiliar emotional keywords appear, a '? button' feature is provided, enabling users to learn the definition and details of those emotions. This process aims to enhance emotional comprehension in the short term, while in the long term, it focuses on providing a sense of achievement to users and forming a positive feedback loop for maintaining good mental health.

### **Calendar-Emotion Collection**
And once an emotion is selected, it is recorded in the calendar to facilitate long-term memorization of one's emotions.

### **Emotion Anthology**
Our service enables users to reflect on the emotions they frequently experience recently, and provides a sense of achievement through gamified elements, where collecting more emotions leads to higher levels. This approach helps users to deeply understand and manage their emotions, while also serving as a mechanism to encourage long-term engagement and use of the service.
